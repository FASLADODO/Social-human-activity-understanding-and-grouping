# Social-human-activity-understanding-and-grouping
We provide track, social group formation and activity annotations on the existing CAD dataset and call it "Social-CAD".
Each sequence of the dataset is provided with a "X_annotations.txt" file where X is the number of sequence. In each file there are 9 columns. Columns <1>, <2-5>, <6>, <7>, <8>, <9> indicate frame-id, bounding box coordinate (x1,y1,x2,y2),  individual action ID, social activity ID, track ID and social group ID respectively.
